  <h3>6.1 General</h3>
 <li> following constrains shall be addressed, required capacity driving pressure, flow induced forces, noise vibration, pressure surges, material degradation, liquid accumulation, sand accumulation.</li>
 <li> Permissible pipe sizes- a minimum of 2 in should be used for all to ensure mechanical integrity.  Smaller piping can be used where protection and support provided to withstand human activity. Minimu size for sewage and open drain header 4 in and subheaders 3 in. overflow pipe in atmoshperic tank shall have largest inlet pipe size as minimum. Tubing used for air, hydraulic oil and non-combustible fluids.</li>

  <h3>6.2 Sizing of liquid lines</h3>
 <li> velocity limitations- velocity kept low to prevent erosion, water hammer pressure surge, noise, reaction forces. Some cases minimum velocity required. When the services is intermittent, the velocity can be increased to 10m/s.</li>
 <li> Centrifugal pump suction and discharge lines- suction piping sized based on NPSH requirement. Maximum velocity and maximum pressure drops “sub cooled liquids (0.25 bar/100m) boiling liquids (0.05 bar/100m)” used. Fluid temperature atleast 15 C below boiling  point. Maximum velocity at discharge as per table 2.2 and pressure drop upto 0.9 bar/100m used.</li>
 <li> Control valve inlet lines- sized such that single phase liquid maintained</li>
 <li> fire water-based on available system pressure and allowable flow velocity. Pressure drop due to large deluge system shall be calculated on basis of most unfavourable pipe routing to those systems. Flow velocity shall not exceed table 2. upstream velocity should not exceed 10m/s. Some areas require more than 10m/s in order to hydraulically balance system, acceptable only when not causing pipe stress.</li>
 <li> Oily water systems- when size of oil drops in water is crucial, can be achieved by providing low flow. Should not exceed 3m/s. Also considered in selection of fittings and instruments to avoid shearing oil droplets.</li>

  <h3>6.3 Liquid flowing by gravity (under sizing of liquid lines)</h3>
 <li> tank overflow, drains. Minimum slope of 1:100 shall be used. With mud or sand slope shall be 1:50. </li>
 <li> Pipes running full that do not require minimum downward slope to avoid particle deposition shall be sized according to total static pressure head and maximum allowable  velocity.</li>
 <li> Near horizontal lines- when not running full sized based on maximum flow capacity.  Liquid entrance  need some acceleration to reach desired velocity. To reduce entrance pressure loss, inlet should have increased diameter than table 3. next diameter selected and reducer used.</li>
 <li> Vertical lines- vertical gravity lines shall be designed so that froude number is less than 0.3, to avoid air entrainment and ensure undisturbed flow without pulsation. Vent included at top to prevent vacuum, flashing or pulsations. Should be designed for air volumetric flow equal to liquid volumetric flow with pressure loss of maximum 0.005 bar.  Also designed  with wave motion into consideration. Liquid inlet for dump caissons should be tangential and sloped downwards. Deluge water drainage based on 50% of the available head. moody factor for turbulent flow by nikuradse formula.</li>


  <h3>6.4 Sizing of gas lines</h3>
 <li> compromise between maximum velocity and allowable pressure drop.</li>
 <li> Piping with gas at dew point and/or with droplets designed as gas line</li>
 <li> maximum velocity-  to avoid noise or vibration. 60 m/s or equation 4  = 175<li>(1/p)^0.43 which ever is lower. (normal operation)</li>
 <li> For anti surge lines, the constant 175 in equation4 replaced with 200 during process upsets, if noise level is acceptable.</li>
 <li> If solid particle exist, special attention given to erosion.</li>
 <li> Recommended pressure drop-  for 0 to 35 barg (0.001 to 0.11 bar/100m), 35-138 (0.11 to 0.2 bar/100m),  over 138 (operating P/500)</li>

  <h3>6.5 Sizing of multiphase lines</h3>
 <li> well-head flow lines, production manifolds, process headers with two phase or multiphase have velocity limits. </li>

 <li> Maximum velocity calculated using V=183*(1/p)^0.5</li>
 <li> unstable flow and slugging considered. The number and length of multiphase lines should be kept minimum.</li>
 <li> Non corrosive- for non corrosive and corrosion resistant pipe, maximum velocity should be limited to 25 m/s if sands included. </li>
 <li> Corrosive service- carbon steel corrosion rate often limits life time. With increased velocity, corrosion increases due to shear forces or increased mass transfer. 10 m/s limitation to prevent erosion of protective layer and reduce the risk for corrosion inhibitor film break down</li>
 <li> particle erosion in non corrosive service- for well stream contaminated with particles, maximum allowable velocity shall be calculated based on sand concentration, piping geometry and added erosion allowance. </li>
 <li> Software used to calculate maximum velocity and life time.</li> 
 <li> If pressure drop is available, the velocity shall be in general sufficiently high to ensure homogeneous flow, which prevents liquid accumulation and allows simple pressure drop calculation.</li>
 <li> If lower velocity required, due to limited pressure drop, problems with slugging and/or liquid accumulation in line considered.</li>

  <h3>6.6 Sizing of flare and vent lines</h3>
 <li> flare line designed to keep pV2 < 200000 kg/ms2.</li>
 <li> When selecting pipe, acoustic fatigue considered, which is affected by  relative differential pressure in upstream restriction device, temperature in flowing gas, mole weight of flowing gas, pipe diameter and wall thickness, mass flow rate.</li>
